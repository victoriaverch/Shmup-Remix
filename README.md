# Shmup-Remix
 Shmup Remix Game

Brainstorm:

My first thought when thinking about shmups was
galatica. When I started to think about a remix idea, I’m
not sure why but the wildfires was the first thing that
came to mind for inspiration. I decided that I could have
the wildfires spreading towards me that I have to shoot
with water bullets. Also, when a fire gets really hot it
pops, that’s where the shooting would come from, is the
fire “popping”. Also as a player you can fill buckets of
water on the top of the screen, that when filled will
empty onto the screen, clearing part of it.

Process: 

Within my game, the player element will be player vs. game. The main point is to
stop the spread of the fire, and get hit by its explosions. The main objective
element will be to “capture”, since the player will be shooting and doing the fire
balls as well as trying to fill the water buckets. Resources is an element that I will
have to look at, since I want to have different parts I have to make sure they end
up being balanced.
A challenge I could try to include other than just dodging and stopping the fires, is
to have some sort of wave were there is a bigger amplifier to the fire that the
player has to kill before it’s too late. I could also make some sort of puzzle out of
the water bucket filling element. Maybe if you fill the buckets in a certain order,
than it triggers a waterfall or a big splash.
The basic rules of my game are to stop the fire from spreading and not to get hit
by its burning embers. 

Second Iteration - The Floor Is Lava: 

After trying to make my wildfire galaga dreams come true, I ran into a lot of issues with spawning that became hard for be to go back on in my project so I strated from scratch.  I kept the fire and lava theme but I changed the storyline behind the game whish ultimately ended up changing all the mechanics too. This version is all about a little water warrior that is trapped on the last bit of land being swallowed by the lava rushing through the forest. He has to protect himself with his littel squirt gun while also dodging the lava pools that come up from the ground! There are a series of waves that the player goes through, that ultimately will begin to loop.  Each wave the enemies go up in health and increase in spawning and speed, as well as having more lava pools to dodge.
